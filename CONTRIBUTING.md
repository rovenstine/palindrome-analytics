We use Conventional Commits

🌿 Branching Strategy

feature/* → new features (e.g., feature/client-dashboard)

bugfix/* → bug fixes

hotfix/* → urgent fixes to production

✅ Pull Request Process

Ensure code is linted and tested

Add/Update documentation if needed

Provide a clear PR description (what/why/how)

One PR per logical change (avoid bundling unrelated updates)

🧪 Testing

All code should include appropriate unit tests in the tests/ directory.
Run tests with:

pytest
